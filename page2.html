<h2>Traveling is Pretty Cool</h2>

<p>Traveling is also up there, for some of my favorite things to do. Traveling allows me to experience different cultures, scenery, 
food, and activities that aren't here in quiet Indiana. I've traveled to 38 of the 50 states, and one of the most underrated states to
travel to in my opinion would be South Dakota. The western part of the state has the Black hills region which is home Mount 
Rushmore. Just to the east you'll find a completely different scene with the Badlands.
